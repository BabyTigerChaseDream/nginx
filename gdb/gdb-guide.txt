2.4 Logging Output
You may want to save the output of GDB commands to a file. There are several commands to control GDBâ€™s logging.

set logging on
Enable logging.

set logging off
Disable logging.

set logging file file
Change the name of the current logfile. The default logfile is gdb.txt.

set logging overwrite [on|off]
By default, GDB will append to the logfile. Set overwrite if you want set logging on to overwrite the logfile instead.

set logging redirect [on|off]
By default, GDB output will go to both the terminal and the logfile. Set redirect if you want output to go only to the log file.

set logging debugredirect [on|off]
By default, GDB debug output will go to both the terminal and the logfile. Set debugredirect if you want debug output to go only to the log file.

show logging
Show the current values of the logging settings.
